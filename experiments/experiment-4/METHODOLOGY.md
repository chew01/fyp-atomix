# Enhanced Precision Failover Testing Methodology

## Scientific Approach

This document outlines the rigorous methodology employed in experiment-4 to provide academically-sound validation of distributed consensus durability during leader failures.

## Research Questions

1. **Primary Question**: Do committed writes survive immediate leader failures in a multi-raft consensus system?
2. **Secondary Questions**: 
   - How does failure timing affect write durability?
   - What are the recovery characteristics of the system?
   - How consistent is the behavior across different scenarios?

## Experimental Design

### Independent Variables
- **Failure Timing**: 0ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 75ms, 100ms, 200ms delays
- **Test Scenario**: Immediate, During Replication, Rapid Sequential, Precision Timed
- **Target Key**: Deterministically mapped to specific partitions

### Dependent Variables
- **Write Survival Rate**: Percentage of writes that survive leader failure
- **Recovery Time**: Duration from leader termination to new leader election
- **Total Test Duration**: End-to-end completion time
- **Consistency**: Value verification after recovery

### Control Variables
- **Consensus Store Configuration**: 3 replicas, 3 groups (constant)
- **Test Environment**: Kubernetes cluster configuration (constant)
- **Network Conditions**: Local minikube environment (constant)
- **Write Size**: Fixed key-value pair sizes (constant)

## Methodology Components

### 1. Deterministic Partition Assignment

**Algorithm**:
```
partition_id = SHA256(key)[0] % partition_count
```

**Rationale**: Ensures reproducible assignment of test keys to specific partitions, enabling targeted leader identification and consistent test conditions.

**Validation**: Each test logs the exact partition assignment and verifies leader identification before failure injection.

### 2. Precise Leader Identification

**Process**:
1. Query Kubernetes API for all RaftGroup resources
2. Parse leader information from each group's status
3. Extract pod name, term number, and state
4. Cache leader information with timestamps
5. Map test keys to their responsible leaders

**Data Structure**:
```go
type LeaderInfo struct {
    PartitionID  int       // Partition identifier (0-2)
    PodName      string    // Kubernetes pod name
    PodIndex     int       // Pod index within the cluster
    Term         int64     // Raft term number
    State        string    // Leader state (ready/not-ready)
    LastUpdate   time.Time // Information freshness
}
```

### 3. Controlled Failure Injection

**Termination Method**:
```go
err := eft.k8sClient.CoreV1().Pods(namespace).Delete(ctx, podName, metav1.DeleteOptions{
    GracePeriodSeconds: new(int64), // Immediate termination (0 grace period)
})
```

**Timing Precision**: Uses Go's time package with nanosecond precision for exact timing measurements.

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Immediate (0ms)**: Simulates sudden hardware failure or network partition
- **During Replication (50-200ms)**: Tests various phases of the consensus protocol
- **Precision Timed (10-75ms)**: Fine-grained analysis of critical timing windows
- **Rapid Sequential**: Tests resilience under cascading failures

### 4. Recovery Monitoring

**Leader Election Detection**:
```go
func (eft *EnhancedFailoverTest) waitForLeaderElection(ctx context.Context, partitionID int, originalTerm int64) (LeaderInfo, error) {
    // Poll every 1 second for up to 30 seconds
    // Success criteria: New leader with higher term number in "ready" state
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- New leader elected with term > original term
- Leader state transitions to "ready"
- Leadership is stable (consistent across multiple checks)

### 5. Data Verification Protocol

**Verification Process**:
1. Wait for leader election completion
2. Execute read operation for the test key
3. Compare retrieved value with original written value
4. Record verification timestamp and result

**Success Criteria**:
- Key exists in the distributed map
- Retrieved value exactly matches written value
- Read operation completes without errors

## Test Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Environment Preparation
```
1. Initialize Kubernetes clients
2. Verify consensus store deployment
3. Confirm leader stability across all partitions
4. Execute connectivity validation
```

### Phase 2: Test Execution Loop
```
For each test scenario:
  For each timing configuration:
    1. Generate unique test identifier
    2. Create deterministic key-value pair
    3. Identify target partition and leader
    4. Record baseline measurements
    5. Execute write operation
    6. Apply configured timing delay
    7. Terminate target leader pod
    8. Monitor leader election process
    9. Verify data persistence
    10. Record comprehensive results
```

### Phase 3: Results Analysis
```
1. Calculate success rates per scenario
2. Compute average recovery times
3. Analyze timing pattern correlations
4. Generate statistical summaries
5. Identify any anomalies or patterns
```

```

## Statistical Analysis

### Success Rate Calculation
```
Success Rate = (Successful Tests / Total Tests) × 100
```

### Recovery Time Analysis
```
Mean Recovery Time = Σ(Recovery Times) / Number of Tests
Standard Deviation = √(Σ(Recovery Time - Mean)² / N)
```

### Timing Correlation Analysis
```
Correlation between failure timing and success rate
Regression analysis of recovery time patterns
```

## Expected Results

### Hypothesis
**H1**: Committed writes will survive immediate leader failures with >99% success rate

- **Local storage**: Different I/O characteristics than distributed storage
- **Container orchestration**: Kubernetes adds abstraction layers

### Methodological Limitations
- **Fixed timing windows**: Limited range of failure timing scenarios
- **Single consensus protocol**: Results specific to Raft implementation
- **Deterministic failures**: Does not test random failure patterns
