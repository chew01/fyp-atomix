## üöÄ Key Enhancements Over Experiment-3

### 1. Precise Leader Identification
- **SHA-256 deterministic key-to-partition mapping**
- **Real-time leader tracking** via Kubernetes API
- **Partition-specific targeting** for controlled failures

### 2. Controlled Failure Injection
- **Targeted pod termination** of specific leaders
- **Precise timing control** (0ms to 200ms delays)
- **Multiple test scenarios** covering different vulnerability windows

### 3. Academic-Quality Measurements
- **Nanosecond precision timing** for all events
- **Complete leader state tracking** (before/after)
- **Statistical analysis** with success rates and correlations
- **Reproducible methodology** for peer review

### 4. Enhanced RBAC Permissions
```yaml
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "delete"]  # Critical: pod deletion capability
```

## üß™ Test Scenarios Implemented

### Immediate Failure (Critical)
```
Write ‚Üí [0ms] ‚Üí Terminate Leader ‚Üí Verify
```
**Academic Significance**: Tests absolute worst-case immediate failure scenario

### During Replication (Vulnerable Windows)  
```
Write ‚Üí [50ms/100ms/200ms] ‚Üí Terminate Leader ‚Üí Verify
```
**Academic Significance**: Tests different phases of consensus replication

### Precision Timed (Fine-grained)
```
Write ‚Üí [10ms/25ms/75ms] ‚Üí Terminate Leader ‚Üí Verify  
```
**Academic Significance**: Fine-grained analysis of critical timing windows

### Rapid Sequential (Cascading)
```
Test1 ‚Üí Test2 ‚Üí Test3 (minimal delays)
```
**Academic Significance**: Tests resilience under rapid successive failures

## üî¨ Technical Innovations

### Deterministic Partition Assignment
```go
func getKeyPartition(key string) int {
    hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(key))
    return int(hash[0]) % partitionCount
}
```

### Leader Information Tracking
```go
type LeaderInfo struct {
    PartitionID  int
    PodName      string
    PodIndex     int
    Term         int64
    State        string
    LastUpdate   time.Time
}
```

### Comprehensive Test Results
```go
type TestResult struct {
    TestID           string
    Scenario         FailoverTestScenario
    Key              string
    Value            string
    WriteTime        time.Time
    FailureTime      time.Time
    RecoveryTime     time.Time
    VerificationTime time.Time
    Success          bool
    Duration         time.Duration
    LeaderBefore     LeaderInfo
    LeaderAfter      LeaderInfo
}
```

## üìä Expected Academic Results
